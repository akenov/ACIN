Have you done any specific preprocessing aside of typical normalization (scale -1 1, zero mean, etc)
based on path name Action-Converted
extendShortActions? is this padding or the interpolation augmentation?
SlidingFrameSequence() - is this a sliding window over the action
apply scale
apply shift
normalize AFTER augmentation? -	I have noticed the normalizeDataActions(actions) is called after the augmentations have been applied
removeConfidenceAndExtractMask() - whats the purpose of the method?
generateFeatureVectorsFromAction()  - whats the purpose of the method?
usage of masks?

self-implemented AdaDelta
def adadelta(lr, tparams, grads, x, mask, y, cost, n_samp, max_lenght_feature):
    """
    An adaptive learning rate optimizer

    Parameters
    ----------
    lr : Theano SharedVariable
        Initial learning rate
    tpramas: Theano SharedVariable
        Model parameters
    grads: Theano variable
        Gradients of cost w.r.t to parameres
    x: Theano variable
        Model inputs
    mask: Theano variable
        Sequence mask
    y: Theano variable
        Targets
    cost: Theano variable
        Objective fucntion to minimize

	f_grad_shared, f_update = adadelta(lr, tparams, grads, x, mask, y, cost,  n_samp, max_lenght_feature)
